1.	What does your script do?
This is a simple script that allows you to display what change you own from the sale. For example, it will ask for a user to input the amount due. The user letâ€™s say puts in $10. Then it will ask how much money was given by the customer. Let's say we got $42.21 you will then get the output:
Give the customer
32 Dollars
0 Quarters
2 Dimes
0 Nickels
1 Pennies

It will then ask if you would want to do another input or type quit to exit. If you type quit, it will exit out otherwise it would restart. 

2.	Describe your process for writing the script
When writing this script, I used some examples I did in class, along with some examples of some projects I did in high school. I also used some of the documentation python has online. 
3.	How did you approach testing your script? Did you have any particularly troublesome problems? If so, how did you solve them?

Yes some issues I ran into were letting this program run in the system cmd. To fix this I had to use os.system to allow the terminal clear itself then exit. Other issues I had were just some small math error mistakes. Most of the stuff I used was from the online documentation python has that has helped me fix problems or make the program do what I want it to do. 

4.	If you could give a word of advice to yourself before you started this assignment; what would it have been?

Probably look at examples and read more documentation instead of just jumping in on it. I was a bit lost on the idea on what to do but then figured a Cashier program was simple enough for me to do based on all the information I knew about python.
